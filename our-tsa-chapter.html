        <h1>The FCCPS TSA Chapter</h1>
        <h3>Great achievements. Great teams.</h3>

    <article>
        <p>In the Falls Church City Public Schools, we have chapters at both our High School, George Mason, and at its counterpart, Mary Ellen Henderson Middle School. While these chapters' teams do not illegally cowork on projects as dictated by the rules of the Technology Student Association, we spend time together in numerous parts of the TSA experience. We travel to competitions together, meet together, and go to meals together after meetings and while attending TSA conventions.</p>
        <p>As a chapter, we have won several notable awards. Last year (2014-2015), we won first place in the state of Virginia in both Community Service Video and Environmental Focus. At the National conference, four of our members (Casandre Rice, Erik Boesen, Evan Lawrence, and Colter Adams) recieved their Gold Acievement Awards. Additionally, our Middle School chapter was one of three in the nation to win the Chapter of Excellence award. More about last year's achievements <a href="http://www.fccps.org/index.php?option=com_k2&view=item&id=3232:meh-tsa-members-love-gold-and-silver" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
        <p>Our High School chapter was established at the beginning of this year, since our older Middle School members had advanced and of course wanted to continue participating in the TSA organization. Members Aziz Shaik and Ben Fong collaborated with our main adult leader, Mr. Ray Wu-Rorrer, and the school to establish a TSA chapter at the high school.</p>
        <p>In our chapter, we make use of several modern tech tools. The most notable of these is GitHub, a platform which we use to collaborate on code-related events. We use a GitHub Organization to allow teams to work together while preventing those not on the team from accessing their work.</p>
