        <p>At George Mason High School, we have a outstanding tech program including a strong TSA chapter.</p>
        <p>Our school holds many tech education opportunities, and you can see it just by looking. In our school, every student has a school-issued MacBook Air, which they use in all of their classes and can take home to work on homework or projects. Our school also has several acedemic technology opportunities, Some of these are our high-end Makerspace, our popular Robotics club, and our Cyberpatriots club.</p>
        <h4>Makerspace</h4>
        <p>Over the summer of 2015, our school took a large amount of saved funds, and was able to begin construction of a high-powered Makerspace where students may work on any and all projects, from art to musical recording to building robots. Some of our members used it during this year's TSA preparation to build the strap-on shoe wheels which we entered in the Inventions and Innovations competition. **Clarification needed!!!</p>

        <h4>Techspace</h4>
        <p>Several years ago, our school's tech department converted an old snack bar into a tech-support kiosk which students are allowed to operate. Those running the kiosk help other students with their MacBook Airs. Students are allowed to seek help or run the Techspace during Mustang Block (the school-wide free period), or during their own open blocks.</p>
        <h4>Robotics Club</h4>
        <p>Our school has a prominent Robotics club, Vae Victis (Team 1418), which meets frequently during the build season to build a powerful machine to compete in the <a href="http://www.first.org/">FIRST Robotics</a> competition. Our middle school counterpart, <a href="http://fccps.org/meh/">Mary Ellen Henderson Middle School</a>, has a <a href="http://www.firstlegoleague.org/">FIRST LEGO Leage</a> robotics competition which feeds into the more advanced club at the High School. Vae Victis members help with numerous aspects of the middle school competition.</p>
        <h4>CyberPatriots</h4>
        <p>At our school (as well as our middle school counterpart), we have a CyberPatriots chapter. CyberPatriots is a club where students can learn the ins and outs of software and how to use their hacking skills ethically. Students learn about bash, penetration testing, and software design.</p>
        <h4>Computer Science classes</h4>
        <p>George Mason has a robust selection of Computer Science and related classes, including Computer Science I, AP, and IB; Computer Graphics I and II; Robotics; <!-- TODO: Add more classes! -->and others. We have two Computer Science teachers at Mason: Mr. William Snyder and Mr. Randall Moran, both of whom also teach Mathematics, a subject closely related to Computer Science.</p>
